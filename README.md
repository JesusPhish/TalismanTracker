# TalismanTracker
Android application for the Talisman board game to track character statistics.

Talisman is a board game published by Fantasy Flight Games (FFG) and based on the Games Workshop (GW) property. Each player selects a character and plays as that character. Every character has a Strength and Craft value used as part of combat and skill challenges around the board as well as a Life value which if it reaches zero the character dies and a Fate value, Fate is a mechanic that allows players to reroll a single dice per round. 

This app is being made primarily as an excuse to teach myself Android development and for personal use. 

I do not own the rights to any of the characters or the Talisman logo used as part of the app. These belong to their respective owners. To date I am only including characters from the core set and expansions which I personally own physical copies of. 

If you wish to make this application for yourself simple make a copy of the repository, create it as a project and export the project as an Android Application. The application requires no special access to install or run.
